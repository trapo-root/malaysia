      <p class="title"><strong>1. How to clean car windshield wipers?</strong></p>
      <p>To clean car windshield wipers, you can follow these steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lift the wiper blades away from the windshield.</li>
        <li>Wipe the rubber blade with a damp cloth or sponge soaked in mild soap and water.</li>
        <li>Gently scrub along the rubber blade to remove dirt, debris, and any buildup.</li>
        <li>Rinse the blade with clean water to remove soap residue.</li>
        <li>Dry the blade with a clean cloth or allow it to air dry before placing it back on the windshield.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="title"><strong>2. How do car wipers work?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Car wipers are designed to clear rain, dirt, and other debris from the windshield for improved visibility while
        driving. The wiper blades, made of rubber or silicone, are attached to metal arms that move in a sweeping motion
        across the windshield. This motion creates friction, allowing the blades to remove moisture and debris from the
        glass surface.
      </p>
      <p class="title"><strong>3. How to refill water in a car wiper?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Car wipers typically use a washer fluid reservoir, which can be filled with a suitable windshield washer fluid.
        Locate the reservoir under the hood of your car, usually near the windshield. Open the cap and pour the washer
        fluid into the reservoir until it reaches the appropriate level indicated on the reservoir or its dipstick.
      </p>
      <p class="title"><strong>4. How to change car wipers?</strong></p>
      <p>To change car wipers, you can follow these general steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lift the wiper arm away from the windshield.</li>
        <li>Locate the attachment point where the wiper blade connects to the arm.</li>
        <li>Depress the small tab or button on the attachment and slide the old wiper blade out.</li>
        <li>Align the new wiper blade with the attachment point and slide it in until it clicks into place.</li>
        <li>Gently lower the wiper arm back onto the windshield.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="title"><strong>5. What does a car wiper do?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Car wipers are essential components of a vehicle's safety system. They are responsible for clearing rain, dirt,
        and other debris from the windshield, ensuring clear visibility for the driver. By maintaining a clear
        windshield, wipers help prevent accidents and improve overall road safety.
      </p>
      <p class="title"><strong>6. What types of wipers are best?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Silicone car wipers, like TRAPO Hydrophobic Car Wipers, are considered the best choice due to their durability,
        smooth operation, hydrophobic properties, all-weather performance, and resistance to streaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional rubber wipers, silicone wipers are highly resistant to wear, extreme temperatures, and
        chemicals. They provide a smooth and quiet wiping action, repel water effectively, and maintain optimal
        visibility in various weather conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        With their exceptional performance and longevity, silicone wipers ensure a safer and clearer driving experience,
        making them the top choice for car owners.

    <summary class="collapsible-tab__heading" style="width:18%"><span><h2>FAQs About Dashcams</h2></span></summary>
    <div class="collapsible-tab__text">
      <h3 class="title"><strong>1. Are dashcams illegal in Malaysia?</strong></h3>
      <p>No, dashcams are not illegal in Malaysia. In fact, they are encouraged as a way to protect yourself on the road. Just ensure the device is installed properly and does not obstruct your view while driving.</p>
      <h3 class="title"><strong>2. What is a dashcam used for?</strong></h3>
      <p>A dashcam records video footage while you're driving and sometimes while parked (if connected to a hardwire kit). It is commonly used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide evidence in the event of an accident</li>
<li>Record hit-and-run incidents</li>
<li>Enhance vehicle security when parked</li>
<li>Protect against road scams and false claims</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="title"><strong>3. Do dashcams use a lot of battery?</strong></h3>
      <p>Not when installed with the right setup. Most dashcams use minimal power when running. If you use a proper hardwire kit like Trapo’s OBD Hardwire Kit, the power draw is controlled and includes a built-in cut-off to protect your car battery from draining.</p>
      <h3 class="title"><strong>4. Is it worth having a dashcam?</strong></h3>
      <p>Yes, it’s definitely worth it. A dashcam can help protect you in accidents, prevent disputes, and speed up insurance claims. In today’s traffic conditions, especially in Malaysia, it’s a smart and practical safety tool for every driver.</p>
